         <h3>Why "Mobile-First" Approach?</h3>
         <ul>Ensures core functionality across the board</ul>
         <ul>2011 introduced the paradigm shift where mobile device usage rose and desktop computer use declined</ul>
         <ul>The average person has multiple mobile devices as compared to a single (possibly shared) desktop</ul>
         <h3>Responsive web design is NOT the same as Mobile-First</h3>
         <ul>It doesn't address screen size usage issues</ul>
         <ul>It doesn't address touch interaction v.s. click issues</ul>
         <h3>Additional Benefits of Mobile-First</h3>
         <ul>Provides the best user experience across a range of devices</ul>
         <ul>Enables designs that address bandwidth concerns</ul>
         <ul>"Future-proof" or Future Friendly - new devices have a greater chance of already being supported</ul>

            A note - Normally I would have more notes, but I am still waiting on my SitePoint code. I watched what I
            could of the Master Mobile UX video for free, and will finish the remainder as soon as I recieve my code.
            <br><br>
            Question - I'm honestly wondering if I should try purchasing access through SitePoint itself at this point. 
            I have a receipt from the bookstore proving that I have purchased a code, but I don't really want to wait
            much longer as I am missing out on time I could be working on completing readings and examples.
