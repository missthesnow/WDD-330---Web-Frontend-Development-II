         <h2>Modular JavaScript</h2>
         <hr>
         <h3>Modules</h3>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">Modules are self-contained pieces of code that provide functions and methods that can then be used in other 
             files and by other modules. Using them helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which 
             improves overal code readability and maintainability. Code in a given module should have a single purpose, 
             and group together functions with distinct functionality. Keeping code 'modular' helps to make it more 
             loosely coupled and interchangeable.</p>
         <h3>Coupling</h3>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">The coupling of code refers to how dependent certain elements or modules of code are on each other. 
             Tightly coupled code means they rely on each other to run or if one relies on the other. This often occurs 
             if a piece of code makes hard-coded references to another piece of code, requiring it to be used. 
             This will often mean that changes to one piece of code will necessitate changes in the other. (Which can
             end up being very tedious.)<br><br>
             Code is said to loosely coupled if one piece of code can be easily substituted by another without 
             affecting the final outcome. This is often achieved by referring to common methods that are shared by 
             the alternative modules. (doing so means that one change doesn't necessitate a great number of others due
             to heardcoding.)<br>
             It is considered good design to keep code as loosely coupled as possible - this allows for the most 
             flexibility in developing systems of code. Different modules can be used independently and in a variety 
             of different applications (rather than being restricted to a single use-case).</p>
