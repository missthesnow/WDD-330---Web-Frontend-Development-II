        <h2>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Transforms</h3>
        <p>The transform property lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. 
            Some of these effects were possible using previously existing CSS features (i.e. translating 
            with relative and absolute positioning) CSS3 gives far more control over many more aspects of 
            the element’s appearance.<br><br>
            Possible transformations include:</p>
            <ul>Translation</ul>
            <ul>Scaling</ul>
            <ul>Rotation</ul>
            <ul>Skew</ul>

        <h3>Transitions</h3>
        <p>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple 
            animations. If the browser lacks support for transitions, the change will be immediate instead 
            of gradual, which is fine and accessible. In addition, native CSS transitions generally require 
            less client-side processing than JavaScript animations, so they’ll usually appear smoother.</p>
        <p style="color: #FFABF9;">This is is an irreplacable benefit when it comes to mobile devices with 
            limited computing power.</p>
        <p>Transition properties include:</p>
        <ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">transition-duration</ul>
        <ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">transition-timing-function</ul>
        <ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">transition-delay</ul>
        <ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">transition shorthand</ul>
        <ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"></ul>
        <p>Possible uses for transitions include:</p>
        <ul>Multiple Transitions</ul>
        <ul>Animations</ul>

     <h2>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
     <hr>
     <h3>Canvas</h3>
     <p>HTML5 has a Canvas API with which we can draw any number of things through JavaScript. This can 
         improve the performance of a website by avoiding the need to download images off the network. 
         With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. Canvas also
         gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video.<br><br>
        The following platforms support the Canvas API:</p>
        <ul>Chrome 4+</ul>
        <ul>Firefox 2+</ul>
        <ul>Opera 9.6+</ul>
        <ul>Safari 3.1+</ul>
        <ul>iOS 3.2+</ul>
        <ul>Internet Explorer 9.0+</ul>
        <ul>Android 3.0+</ul>
     <p style="color: #FFABF9;">Canvas must be inserted as its own element, which can then be grabbed 
        from the DOM after giving the canvas an ID like so:</p>
     <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
        &lt;canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas"&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry! Your browser doesn’t support Canvas.<br>
        &lt;/canvas&gt;</p>

     <h3>SVG</h3>
     <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allowsthe description of 
         vector graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, unlike 
         many other image types (bitmaps, i.e. GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their 
         quality regardless of scaling. We can be used SVG in may similar ways to the canvas.<br><br></p>
     <p>Basic SVG is supported on the following platforms:</p>
        <ul>Chrome 4+</ul>
        <ul>Safari 3.2+</ul>
        <ul>Firefox 3+</ul>
        <ul>Opera 9.6+</ul>
        <ul>iOS 3.2+</ul>
        <ul>Internet Explorer 9.0+</ul>
        <ul>Android browser 4.4+</ul>        
     <p style="color: #FFABF9;">Canvas versus SVG?<br></p>
     <p>Depends! Canvas allows for pixel manipulation, a downside however though - it operates in what’s 
         known as 'immediate' mode. This means that if you ever want to add more to the canvas, you’re unable 
         to simply add to what’s already there. Every time you finish drawing a shape, the canvas no longer 
         has access to that shape, because it won’t persist as an object that you can modify - you'd have to 
         start from scratch. Canvas does allow you to save the images you create to a PNG or JPEG file though.<br><br>

        Canvas is also much faster than SVG because there's no access it on the DOM.<br><br>       
        
        What you draw to SVG is accessible via the DOM, because its mode is 'retained' mode, meaning that the 
        structure of the image is preserved in the XML document that describes it. SVG also has, at this time, 
        a more complete set of tools to help you work with it.<br><br>

        However, since SVG is a file format—rather than a set of methods that allows you to dynamically draw on 
        a surface—you can’t manipulate SVG images the way you can manipulate pixels on canvas. It would have been 
        impossible, for example, to use SVG to convert our color video to black and white as we did with canvas.</p>

     <h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
     <p>The Drag and Drop API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what 
         should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.<br><br></p>
         <p>The Drag and Drop API is supported on the following platforms:</p>
         <ul>All recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari</ul>
         <ul>Partial support in Internet Explorer 7.0+ (IE10 doesn’t allow setting the drag image, but supports all other features)</ul>
         <ul>Opera 12+</ul>
